Analyzing Data using Hive from Cloudera CDH

Worked on Cloudera CDH using Hive. Used Hue interface to work on datasets to find out analysis about employees and sales from Best Buy stores.
Made use of SerDe module to take care of quotes or other irregularities in data. Migrated the data to Hive environment in cloudera and 
used other Hive modules like Cube. Used functions and joins as well to get desired results.
